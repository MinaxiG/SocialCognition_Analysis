# Can mentalizing interacting shapes lead to Empathy in humans?

This project is being carried out during Neuromatch Academy (NMA), 2020. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSeQvp-rpTE) to our presentation.

## ➊ Scientific questions
Do people empathize with socially interacting shapes?  What can we relate to when watching different shapes interacting with each other, or can we relate at all? Which brain regions get activated or which neurons do the brain fire when mentalizing with such objects.

## ➋ Brief scientific background 
The perceptions of the participants can be directly attributed to the ability to reflect on the emotional and instinctive responses in others often referred to as ‘mentalizing’. However, one concept that goes hand in hand with mentalizing is empathy. 


## ➌ Dataset and analyses
- Dataset: 
Human Connectome Project (Social Cognition dataset), consisting of fMRI data of participants viewing animated videos of shapes (circles, triangles, or squares) either interacting with each other or moving randomly.

- Analyses:
  - Subtraction Analysis
  - Correlation Analysis

## ➍ Conclusion
We observed:
1. Correlations between temporal-parietal-occipital junction, auditory association region, lateral temporal region, and medial-prefrontal cortex, manifesting the underlying connectivity of social cognition.

2. More clear contrast when the true random was considered as control as compared to the resting state condition.

3. Subtraction analysis yielded better results when the participant responses were considered as compared to when only condition-based analysis is performed.

4. The subtraction analysis between the perceived mental and random interactions for the mental condition resulted in relatively high contrast in a region close to the posterior superior temporal sulcus. This is the same region found to be less active for the people having Autism.

It was an amazing experience from figuring out the research question, to diving into the dataset, reframing the hypothesis as and when we gain new insights and performing the analysis.

But, without constant support from NMA, whether it’s TA’s helping hand, Mentors’ guidance or the dataset updates and prompt responses from the Neurostars community, this project and tutorials wouldn’t have possible.
